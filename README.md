# hextechhunt

HextechHunt is a web application that will allow League of Legends players to keep track of their Hextech Chest rewards via Champion Mastery for the current season. Players can enter their Summoner name and select their Region to view a comprehensive list of Champions that they have played, and see whether or not they have been granted a Hextech Chest as a reward for Champion Mastery. The list will also indicate which Champions hold a significant potential to reward the user with a Chest if they have not been rewarded already.

##Special Thanks
Special thanks to Riot Games for giving us the opportunity to create these awesome, game-data-driven applications. Win or lose this API Challenge (April 2016), it has been a most pleasurable experience to create my own application featuring Riot Games data and League of Legends. And just to be safe...
